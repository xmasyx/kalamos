## What this project commits to

These are not aspirations. Each one is either enforced by the code or checkable
by you, and [Privacy](privacy.md) tells you how to check.

**Nothing you say leaves the machine.** No account, no login, no analytics, no
crash reporting, no "anonymous usage statistics" sent anywhere. The only outbound
request Kalamos ever makes is the one-time model download on first run. After
that it works with the network off — try it.

**What touches the disk, precisely.** Two things, both local, both inspectable,
because "we store nothing" is usually a lie and you should not have to take it on
faith:

- **The last 25 transcriptions**, in the app's own preferences
  (`~/Library/Preferences/com.kalamos.app.plist`). They exist so a mis-fired paste
  or a wrong focused field never loses what you said: they are listed in the menu,
  one click copies any of them back, and **Clear History** deletes them all. Never
  transmitted, never more than 25.
- **A timestamp-only usage log** — the time you dictated, never the text — so
  `Scripts/analyze-idle.ts` can suggest an idle timeout that fits how you actually
  work.

Full transcript logging exists for debugging, is **off by default**, and `--doctor`
keeps warning you for as long as it is on.

**No subscription, no tiers, no upsell.** MIT licensed. There is no paid version
to be nudged toward, because there is no paid version.

**It fails loudly or not at all.** A silent fallback that returns plausible text
is worse than an error, because you cannot see it. This is not theoretical: a
substring bug once classified iTerm2 as a code editor — its bundle id is
`com.googlecode.iterm2`, and "googlecode" contains "code" — so AI cleanup was
skipped in the terminal for months, with no visible symptom at all. That class of
failure now has tests, and `--doctor` exists to make the rest of it visible.

**Your Mac is not a datacenter.** Both models unload themselves from memory after
you stop dictating and come back in a few seconds. The idle timeout is yours to set,
including "never".
